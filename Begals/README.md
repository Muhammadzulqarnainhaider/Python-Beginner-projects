Import and Constants:

Python
import random 
<!--  -->

# NUM_DIGITS = 3 
# MAX_GUESSES = 10 
<!--  -->

import random: This line imports the random module, which is used to generate random numbers.
NUM_DIGITS: This constant sets the number of digits in the secret number (3 in this case).
MAX_GUESSES: This constant sets the maximum number of guesses allowed (10 in this case).
Main Function:

Python
def main():
    # Game introduction and rules
    ...
Use code with caution.

The main() function is the entry point of the program.
It prints the game introduction and rules, explaining the game to the player.
Game Loop:

Python
while True:
    # Generate a secret number
    ...
Use code with caution.

This is the main game loop that continues until the player decides to quit.
Generating the Secret Number:

Python
def getSecretNum():
    # Create a list of digits
    ...
Use code with caution.

The getSecretNum() function generates a random 3-digit number with no repeated digits.
It creates a list of digits from 0 to 9, shuffles them, and then converts the first 3 digits to a string.
Getting Guesses and Clues:

Python
while numGuesses <= MAX_GUESSES:
    # Get a valid guess from the player
    ...
Use code with caution.

This loop handles the player's guesses and provides feedback.
It ensures the guess is a 3-digit number and calls the getClues() function to provide hints.
Providing Clues:

Python
def getClues(guess, secretNum):
    # Compare guess and secret number
    ...
Use code with caution.

The getClues() function determines the clues based on the player's guess.
It checks for exact matches (Fermi), partial matches (Pico), and no matches (Bagels).
Game Over and Replay:

Python
print('Do you want to play again? (yes or No)')
if not input('>').lower().startswith('y'):
    break
Use code with caution.

After the game ends, it asks the player if they want to play again.
Explanation of Key Parts:

random.shuffle(number): This shuffles the list of digits randomly.
len(guess) != NUM_DIGITS or not guess.isdecimal(): This checks if the guess is valid (3 digits and only numbers).
clues.append('Fermi'): Adds 'Fermi' to the clues list for a correct digit in the correct position.
clues.append('Pico'): Adds 'Pico' to the clues list for a correct digit in the wrong position.
clues.sort(): Sorts the clues list alphabetically.
' '.join(clues): Converts the clues list into a string with spaces between clues.
Overall:

The code implements a number guessing game where the computer generates a random 3-digit number, and the player tries to guess it within 10 attempts. The computer provides clues to help the player. The game can be played multiple times.
